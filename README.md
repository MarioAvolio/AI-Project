# Question Answering (QA) System for Customer Reviews

## Overview

This project aims to develop a Question Answering (QA) system tailored for customer reviews. The system leverages a combination of retrieval-based and generative approaches to extract relevant answers from a corpus of customer reviews. The project utilizes various components and technologies, including:

- Span classification for answer extraction.
- Pre-trained language models fine-tuned on large-scale QA datasets.
- The Retriever-Reader architecture for document retrieval and answer extraction.
- The Haystack library for building the QA pipeline.
- BM25 algorithm for efficient document retrieval.
- Domain adaptation techniques to improve reader performance.
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for abstractive QA.
