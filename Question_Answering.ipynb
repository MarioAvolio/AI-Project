The sound and picture quality and special effects alone are worth the price of the DVD.Despite the strengths of the special effects, I must say that the script and the acting are extremely weak at times during the movie.  For example, little 5-year-old Anakin Skywalker hits on the Princess at many times during the movie.  Those scenes are extremely unrealistic.  I just find it really hard to believe that little brat would flirt that much with the adult princess.Also, Anakin Skywalker simply cannot act.  That boy basically reads his lines without much emotion.  I think that the little kid from the 6th Sense would have played a much better Anakin Skywalker.What genius decided that it would be a good idea to have JarJar Binks in almost every scene?  I do understand that JarJar is supposed to provide comic relief.  However, JarJar is not funny at all - he's just really annoying.And what's the deal with the Jedi blood test?

Not only because it was visually the most dazzling, it also had far more sense of wonder and magic  than the other Episodes. Never had a &quot;Star Wars&quot;-film a greater  emotional impact.&quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; is definetly not on par  with that film, nor has it the originality of &quot;A New Hope&quot;, but  still I liked this film a lot. I actually found it better than &quot;Return  Of The Jedi&quot;. Even those who dispised the movie must acknowledge that  it has its merits. The special effects are fantastic, and in contrast to  other films with superior FX, they are also highly imaginative because they  create entire worlds of their own. Individual action-setpieces are among  the most exhilarating of the decade (the pod-race or the final  lightsaber-duel among others) and John William's score is one of the major  assets again.Many complained that Jar Jar Binks is too silly and  childish. This criticism is understandable though I think many people  overreacted with their hatred towards this character. He actually has some  funny moments. That the film doesn't have a villain that is as effective as  Darth Vader is true and false. The villain does not YET appear as the  villain which will (hopefully) make him even more evil in the next  pictures. The decision to conceal the true menace (careful viewers still  found it of course) is already implied in the Episode's title, so it was  obviously deliberate. This must be the reason why Darth Maul is used so  rarely. The character has just no significance for the whole saga. One must  not forget that TMP is not a film, but the first two hours of a  13-hour-saga. It was therefore inevitable that it would be less dramatic as  &quot;Empire&quot;.The bottom line is that despite some shortcomings,  Episode I effectively sets up the future Episodes. I agree with those who  say that George Lucas should have underlined some of the darker aspects of  the story more than he did. Let's hope he will do so in the next two  chapters which have the potential to become even stronger movies.

              "  'context': 'Well, I have to admit I wasn\\'t expecting to like this movie, having read all the bad press surrounding it.  But I saw it last night on a whim and I have to say I thought it was fantastic!  Firstly, as a movie it is incredibly well shot.  The scenery is wonderful and the sets are painstakingly recreated - never once do you doubt this is 1st century Palestine.The acting starts off a little strained in the garden scene, when the movie is just finding it\\'s feet (and the audience is coming to terms with the fact that the movie isn\\'t some horrible, cheap propaganda short, but a proper movie) but quickly becomes impressive and ends up brutally real.Gibson has set out to make a compelling dramatization of the last 12 hours of Jesus\\' life as described in the Gospels and that\\'s pretty much what he does.  There is certain artistic license taken and some good abstract movie-making, but nothing that really detracts from the movie or the sentiment.  In fact the scenes where they have the Billy Corgan/ Marylin Manson devil figure floating around are amongst the strongest scenes in the movie (Especially the gratuitously freakish defomed child at the whipping! What was that about?!).  The movie is shocking, and at times painful to watch.  I think the movie only strays into questionably graphic violence occasionally, most notable when Christ\\'s hands are nailed to the cross and we see blood squirting up onto the Roman soldier\\'s smirking face.  That\\'s a touch over the top for my taste.Being an UWS-dwelling New Yorker, I had the anti-Semitic accusations in the back of my mind for the whole movie, and I have to say I found nothing that could possibly be construed as anti-Semitic.  Instead the movie shows a nuanced and balanced set of Jewish characters who run the gamut of emotions from hating Jesus to loving him from falsely accusing him to insisting on a fair trial.  To read some press reviews I\\'d assumed the movie was full of big-nosed demons laughing maniacally in shadowy corners - that impression is patently absurd, in fact even Jesus\\' Pharisee accusers are sickened by his whipping and turn away in anguish and perhaps contrition.  If anything it is the Romans who 2000 years later are amongst Catholicism\\'s staunchest supporters, that revel in the torture and mockery of Christ.  But hey, it\\'s all there in the gospels.I think this is a pretty \"Catholic\" film.  Historically the Catholic faith has always revered the human side of Jesus more strongly.  They worship him for his suffering on our behalf his death for our sins, and yes his long, drawn out death.  Speaking from the Protestant tradition I\\'d prefer to see a movie that celebrated Jesus\\' life and teachings more than his suffering, and perhaps brought out the good news of his resurrection more than this movie, but hey, Mel has another 33 years of material to work with should he choose to make a sequel or a prequel.I\\'m not sure that this movie will make many converts - it\\'s a compelling and powerful piece of art, but any theology is brief and death related - flashbacks to scenes in Jesus\\' earlier ministry deal with specific death prophesies (\"This is my Body, broken for you...\" etc) or somewhat heavy-handed juxtapositions of his teaching vs his treatment (\"Love thy neighbour, and love thine enemy likewise.\").  I\\'m not sure that this condensed and selective teaching will convert anyone up front, but it\\'s already made me reread a few of the gospels.Anyway, I think it\\'s a movie everyone should see to make up their own mind about - personally I can\\'t wait for the DVD release so I can watch it without subtitles, as Gibson originally intended. That\\'d be even more brutal...'},\n",

              "  'context': '\"The Passion Of The Christ\" is brilliant and one of the best pictures of the year, so far! The movie focuses on the last 12 hours of Jesus\\' (Jim Caviezel) life leading up to his death and resurrection. This movie has some very graphic scenes, but don\\'t let the violence concern you. It is a powerful depiction of the last 12 hours of Jesus\\' life, thanks in part to its director, the brilliant Mel Gibson, who directed and starred as Justin Mcleod in \"The Man Without A Face\" and William Wallace in \"Braveheart\", the latter, which won him the Best Director Oscar. He also well known as Dr. Gibbon in \"The Singing Detective\" (2003), Graham Hess in \"Signs\" (2002), Lt. Col. Hal Moore in \"We Were Soldiers\" (2002), Nick Marshall in \"What Women Want\" (2000), Benjamin Martin in \"The Patriot\" (2000), Porter in \"Payback\" (1999), Martin Riggs in the Lethal Weapon movies (1987, 1989, 1992, 1998), Jerry Fletcher in \"Conspiracy Theory\" (1997), Tom Mullen in \"Ransom\" (1996), the voices of Rocky and John Smith in \"Chicken Run\" (2000) and \"Pocahontas\" (1995), Bret Maverick in \"Maverick\" (1994), Capt. Daniel McCormick in \"Forever Young\" (1992), Hamlet in \"Hamlet\" (1990), Mad Max Rockatansky in the Mad Max movies (1979, 1981, 1985, 2005 or 2006), and Fletcher Christian in \"The Bounty\" (1984). His directing in this movie is brilliant without compromise. Everything he did to make this movie has paid off brilliantly. The cast including Monica Bellucci as Mary Magdalene, Maia Morgenstern as Mary, Jesus\\' mother, are brilliant as well. Caviezel\\'s performance as Jesus, is emotionally powerful and brilliant and as the co-anchor of the movie, besides, Gibson, does a brilliant job as much as Gibson did. Gibson\\'s production company, Icon Productions, has produced movies of his such as, \"The Singing Detective\" (2003), \"Payback\" (1999), \"What Women Want\" (2000), \"Braveheart\" (1995), \"We Were Soldiers\" (2002), \"Fairy Tale: A True Story\" (1997), \"Forever Young\" (1992), \"Hamlet\" (1990), \"The Man Without A Face\" (1993), and \"Maverick\" (1994). The screenplay by Benedict Fitzgerald and Gibson is brilliant. The music by John Debney is brilliant. The cinematography by Caleb Deschanel is brilliant. The film editing by John Wright is brilliant. The production design by Francesco Frigeri and the costume design by Maurizio Millenotti is brilliant. The casting by Shaila Rubin is brilliant. The set direction by Carlo Gervasi is brilliant. The visual and make-up effects by Greg Cannom and Keith Vanderlaan is brilliant. This movie make a powerful point about how Jesus died and the point is brilliant and succeeds on every level. The language, which is in Aramaic, Latin, and Hebrew, which is shown in English subtitles, proves that you don\\'t need to speak English to have a brilliant film with heart and soul. Go see this movie now or if you can see it. This is an achievement on every level. It is a movie to remember forever.'},\n",

              "  'context': \"I just had a few miscellaneous comments on a film that has already sparked a good deal of controversy.This was destined to be a controversial film right from the start, with the concerns ranging from whether it was too violent to whether it was anti-Semitic. Well, to address the first concern, you can't have a successful movie these days without a lot of gratuitous sex, drugs, and violence, and since this is 2000 years ago and there weren't that many recreational drugs back then, they probably had to step up the violence quotient a bit to compensate, although I suspect people had sex back then, too. It just wasn't the object of as much existential angst, and AIDS was 2000 years in the future, so there were certain advantages to living in ancient times, even if you couldn't run down to the corner store and get a cold sixpack at 2 am in the morning.But getting back to the movie, this is certainly a powerful and evocative depiction of the last 12 hours of the life of Christ, and the entire cast really is superb. Although I usually don't like going to movies with subtitles, I didn't mind it in this case since Aramaic was the language of Jesus and it was interesting to hear it spoken, as I've only seen it written up to this point and had never heard it. A little piece of trivia here--classical Aramaic was thought by linguists to be another dead Semitic language (like Akkadian, Assyrian, Ugaritic, Phoenician, Punic, Coptic, Ammonite, Moabite, and the classical Arabic of the Koran, and Hebrew was dead until they brought it back), until an obscure congregation in Egypt and several other communities were found to be using it some years ago, although it was a more modern dialect. So I liked that aspect of the movie although I doubt I'll be trying to learn any dead Semitic languages anytime soon.The movie was indeed pretty violent, but ancient times certainly have no monopoly on violence compared to modern times, and more people died during the massive world wars and many smaller wars, genocides, purges, revolutions, and various other social conflagrations of the 20th century (which was at least 100 million people) than were probably even alive 2000 years ago. I also didn't find the movie anti-Semitic, and if the Jews hadn't killed Jesus some other group probably would have.So despite the controversial elements, overall, I think this was a well-done movie whose good points outweigh its bad points, and whatever the final critical judgment on it is, I'm sure the movie will be hotly debated and discussed for many years to come.\"},\n",

              "  'context': 'Say what you want about Mel Gibson, but when he is making a serious movie, he knows what he\\'s doing.I thought \"Apocalypto\" was not very good, mainly because of its ridiculous violence and its quite one-dimensional portrayal of an entire culture. What was the point? Mel Gibson seemed to be saying \"boy, these people were violent and wrong.\"But this sort of unipolar viewpoint, which did not serve \"Apocalypto\" at all, fits this film to a tee. Gibson is clearly a committed Christian of the Catholic stripe, and he has created pretty much the ultimate cinematic portrayal of the story of Christ\\'s crucifixion. I can\\'t imagine a film which would better indicate the depth of the physical suffering that Jesus of Nazareth must have endured, and the emotional pain this would inflict upon his relatives and best friends.The sets are all very detailed and ring quite true to the period. The actors in lead \"good guy\" roles are perhaps a bit too European looking, but given the film\\'s production in Italy, some of this is forgivable. Either way, people have cast these characters with their own ethnicity for eons, so I\\'m willing to give that a pass.I kind of wish some of the more mystical elements had been left out. Jesus heals a roman soldier during his capture. Judas is attacked (in his mind at least) by little hobgoblin demon children. Christ is also tempted by Satan - who is played and visualized quite well by a spooky-looking actress, but nonetheless this feels like a bit of a tacked on element, despite mentions in the Gospels at various points. These elements are at worst a minor annoyance, but they strain credulity, which probably runs counter to Gibson\\'s purposes.I guess I would have preferred that the human elements of the story stand on their own, because, frankly, that\\'s all we have access to at this late date. We simply can\\'t trust miracle stories and talk of mystical happenings. We don\\'t have access to them. But by meditating on the human aspects of the story, we have something we can relate to and which may inspire faith in the other, less tangible things. To display them openly is to assume their existence before we are faithful.But this is just my opinion, I suppose, based on my reading, studies in philosophy, and my general skeptical bent. I\\'ve never seen a miracle, and no one I\\'ve trusted has ever reported one to me. Things handed down from 2000 years ago, re-translated dozens of times, do not strike me as reliable sources for amazing stories, none of which seem to happen in modern history and with the benefit of all the technology we have available to us to record such events. I mean, given all the cell phone cameras out there, where are all the indubitable miracles?Anyhow, I digress (my apologies to David Hume...). Even with its mystical trappings, this film in its immediacy and its viscerality certainly succeeds in forcing the viewer to ponder the human aspects. The mystical stuff is a sideshow, so to speak.For those with faith, this film should offer a potent meditation on a story which has been ingrained into the psyche, practically since birth. For a non-believer, this film offers a valuable insight into the passion that believers have for this story and for the man himself. Like a Socrates, Jesus of Nazareth seems to have been a singular man, the like of which is rarely seen. Contemplating this can deepen a non-believer\\'s appreciation, if not deliver them into a completely faithful orientation to the material.To put it briefly, it\\'s a brilliant film. Each shot is lovingly composed, and the visual impact and beauty of the images can\\'t be faulted. The performances all feel very real and there is no actor who takes the viewer away from the time period. Gibson, similar to some of the other great directors such as Kubrick, Scorsese, Stone and he like, excels at  creating \"scene.\" You really feel like \\'you are there.\\'*******The Blu-Ray:The picture is quite beautiful. Black levels are solid, detail is quite good (though perhaps not the absolute best, I would say \"Dark Knight\" and \"Alexander\" top it), and color is very naturalistic. There is a bit of \"posterization\" in some shots of the sky (i.e. a sort of digital distortion or dot-crawl), but it only intrudes on 10 or 20 seconds of the film, and is probably in the source material. The DTS audio mix offers some nice directional effects, with crowd taunts and bird chirps in the rear sound field.Technically, it\\'s about as good as I can imagine it looking. I did not see the film in the theater, so I cannot compare the level of fidelity.Extras include commentaries, and a \"recut\" version, which apparently is actually a bit shorter than the theatrical release. This version also cuts a bit of violence. A word to parents - cutting five minutes of gruesome violence leaves about, oh, 120 minutes of gruesome violence remaining in the movie. So plan accordingly insofar as your children can tolerate these kinds of things. Other extras: There are several commentaries on the main disc. The extra disc has many short documentaries on both production issues and historical context, though none are in HD, unfortunately.*********So should you buy it? Well, that\\'s a tough question. If you\\'re a devoted Christian who enjoys pondering these mysteries, and you also have a good HD setup, then sure, I can\\'t see any reason not to. If you are not a Christian but are curious about what the hub-bub is about, then this is definitely worth at least a rental. Fans of historical fiction/docudrama will certainly find much to appreciate.Whether or not you buy it, this is definitely a film everyone should see at least once. It is a great film, like it or lump it. It is a vivid and very impactful telling of one of the very few central stories of our global culture. Keep in mind I do not want to put a Christian gloss on humanity here - if there were comparable films on Mohammad (a bit of an issue given the icon prohibition), Buddha, etc., I would recommend seeing those as well.On the whole, by any standards, this is a five-star release. It may not be for everyone\\'s permanent collection. But those who add this Blu-Ray title to their shelf will not be disappointed.'},\n",

              "  'context': 'On February 25, 2004 at 5:30 PM, I wasn\\'t exactly sure how to feel because I was sitting in front of a screen that was ready to project what\\'s been called one of the most controversial and brutal films ever made. I was ready to settle in for some trailers, but there were none. The film started precisely on schedule, and I was already taken aback by the sudden commencement of the film. I wasn\\'t sure how to prepare myself. I knew that I was going to witness disturbing frames of film, but the result was more than I can say. Simply put it, \"The Passion of the Christ\" is an experience that cannot be described in words, but only in the art form that Mel Gibson has created to express a feeling like no other. In this review, I will rave about the film being the best ever. Why? Because it is.\"The Passion,\" as most call it in short, is not only Mel Gibson\\'s finest work (he had previously directed \"Bravehart\" and \"The Man Without a Face,\" two fabulous films) but it is the most triumphant motion picture ever to hit the big screen. What we see here is a film with a direct focus that has the ability to create an emotion that is completely indescribable. The focus is on the title, which Gibson uses as the centerpiece of what his film is truly about, and that is the willpower of Jesus Christ, the love and the passion that resided in his body to carry on through the worst possible human torture that anyone has ever endured in history. The only way to really feel that and to express that theme is to show the graphic violence that was depicted by several amazing special effects artists whom worked on this film. On film, it was no longer make-up or special effects; it was real, completely real. Exaggerated? Yes, of course, that\\'s how a theme is drawn out. Although it was the most violent picture I have ever seen in my life, it was made that way to complete this theme of passion. The actual passion is what Jesus had to endure, and had the film been shown any other way that passion could never be conveyed.Every frame of Gibson\\'s work is a concentrated art and has pure perfectionism written all over it. Much of the great visual aspects of the film can be credited to cinematographer Caleb Deschanel, an artist whose work has been nominated several times for Oscars on films such as \"The Natural\" and \"The Patriot.\" To further Mel\\'s perfectionism, he relied on production designer Francisco Frigeri and costume designer Maurizio Millenotti to create the very accurate period look to the film. The frighteningly realistic makeup and special-effects were done by Greg Cannom and Renato Agostini, two artists who have now excelled to the most supreme level of movie magic. I also appreciated John Debney\\'s score that was fluent throughout the entire film. As a matter of fact, I can\\'t think of any moments in the film that did not have music playing. It was a really great way to enhance a story that was foreign to our ears and depended on subtitles to convey the literal text of the film. Debney really found his own way of telling a story through music, keeping the audience entrenched in the world Mel Gibson has set us in.And finally, the acting was brutally realistic. Jim Caviezel had the incredibly difficult task of bringing the most beloved figure in history to the screen, Jesus Christ. His performance is worthy of more than an Oscar, but it should be considered one of the top five best performances in the history of film. Rosalinda Celentano had the task of bringing histories most despised figure to screen, Satan. She was not just some creepy figure that made the film scary, but she had a distinct purpose in being the obstacle in Jesus\\' life. Her constant interference was used to tempt Jesus down a path that would eliminate all passion and glory. I really liked the use of her eyes. It created a distinct look that when she stared at the camera, you felt the intimidation that Jesus was feeling, and the provocation that Jesus felt when she smiled at him. In Gibson\\'s visual style, this would be credited as the motif for the temptation towards Christ. Monica Bellucci played the beautiful Mary Magdalene, a lover of Jesus. She did her job creating emotion alongside another performer whom swept me away, Maia Morgenstern as Mary, Mother of God. What an amazing job she did in creating the passion of a loving mother. Absolutely stunning. Makeup, effects, and costume do a lot to enhance a character, but performance is what makes them real.As a film reviewer, it\\'s not my job to do what I really don\\'t want to do, and that is touch upon the controversy. Before viewing the film I promised myself I wouldn\\'t, but it now seems necessary because I have a few things that need to be cleared up. Anti-Semitic my ass. This film spills the truth. This is what happened in the Bible, this is what the Christian society believes, and this is how it MUST be told. Any other way would disgrace and insult the passages that we know in the Great Book itself. And let me explain how it all works. Did the Jews kill Christ? Yes. Was Jesus Jewish himself? Yes. Oh, and there was another Jewish man who came along to help Christ carry the Cross. In addition, Jesus\\' Jewish family and friends were on his side. So really, what can we compare this to? Well, if we would all like to use our precious brains that God gave us for just once without trying to stand on some large mountain and get attention by protesting these issues, just think Civil War. Essentially, that\\'s all this is. It is a community of Jewish people all hurting each other. Some are on the good side, Jesus\\' side; others are on the bad side, Caiphas\\' side. So why all of a sudden is it Mel Gibson demising a Jewish community whom are all in a conflict? What if he made a picture about the Civil War? Would he be insulting Americans, saying that Americans killed, well, Americans? Honestly, let\\'s think of the circumstances. No matter what group of people you put in there they will all be considered as being demised by Gibson for killing Christ. The fact that it is Jews in the Bible makes it no more than a Civil War, and if we have to cry out and say that that\\'s anti-Semitic, well then we have more issues than I realized, and I only hope there\\'s enough tissues to go around and collect all the tears from these crybabies who are protesting. And that\\'s all I have to say about that.Bottom line, it\\'s not just any great film to see, but far beyond. It is a great experience to go through and to feel. Any person that comes out of this movie saying it wasn\\'t a great experience must be a heartless and cold being with no feeling of remorse for anyone. I hope everyone will see this film and understand what one man went through and \"the passion\" he had to carry on with it further than any human could ever possibly tolerate, regardless of their religious beliefs. You will be moved by this great motion picture epic, I guarantee it.Grade: A++ (first ever)-Rock Hogan'},\n",

              "  'context': 'The Passion of the Christ, the very controversial Mel Gibson religious epic has been highly anticipated and now released.  I had the priviledge of seeing last night and was not disappointed, but I should point out that this is the kind of film which you can\\'t \"like\" or \"dislike.\"  The film stays true or mostly true to the Gospel it\\'s based upon.  The film tells of the last 12 hours of Christ\\'s life.  The depicitions of the crucifixition are quite graphic and very intense, this film is not recommended to be viewed by children.  Though I should also add that it is not the most violent or bloody film that has been made or that I have seen.Caleb Deschanel\\'s cinematography is outstanding and should definetly be nominated for an Academy Award next year along with John Debney\\'s engrossing music score.  James Caviezel does a great job portraying Jesus of Nazareth along with Monica Bellucini and others.  Mel Gibson is very capable as a director as he is an actor, he certainly proved that to us with the glorious epic, Braveheart.  I must say that this film is not anti-semetic in its views, and it certainly should be viewed as a telling of the Gospel.  Gibson simply made a movie about the last 12 hours of Jesus\\'s life, he\\'s not making any accusations.The film which opened on Ash Wednesday (2/25/04) has already grossed an outstanding $117.6 over the 5 day period along with $76.2 million over the weekend.  It certainly has proved to be a success and of blockbuster caliber, the film\\'s budget was only about $25 million which Mel Gibson put in, in other words he used his own money to make the film.  This is the second-highest grossing \"R\" rated film after The Matrix Reloaded.  Of course you shouldn\\'t see this movie for its success at the box-office, if you\\'re very religious and want to experience a movie which should be experienced by everyone, then see The Passion of the Christ.The Passion of the Christ is rated R for Sequences of Graphic Violence.  The violence as stated earlier is intense and brutal.  During the crucifixtion, the nails are hammered into Jesus\\'s hands and feet in slow motion, Jesus\\'s body is drenched with blood.  There\\'s also an extended scene of Jesus being savagely punished at the hands of malicious Roman soldiers.  Though the film\\'s violence might derive you from seeing this film, you should definetly experience especially at the movie theatre.  You must see it to believe it, see The Passion of the Christ'},\n",

This film is excellent. The performances are solid and emotional. The music is brooding, haunting, tense, and beautiful. The photography is the same for me. Often dark and gloomy and gritty but it works. It has a beauty all its own as well.Now let me use another g word. Gory. Be warned: This film is NOT meant as entertainment. It is like SCHINDLER'S LIST in the sense that it is unflinchingly brutal in it's depiction of a very emotional and true event.I was crying almost THROUGHOUT the film, at LEAST five times, but I lost count quickly. People asked me how old a child should be to see this. My answer was don't take children. If you REALLY want to, see it yourself and TALK with your child about it before going in. Be sure you know what a child can and cannot handle.Let me cut to the chase here. This film to me is NOT anti-Semitic. It did make me think though. It made me think how lucky I am that Jesus Christ really loves me and loves me enough that He would and has died for my sins and the sins of the world AND risen from the dead so that all who call on Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord can be with Him in Heaven forever. As a Christian, this film was a graphic reminder to me of the incredible price that my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ paid to redeem me from sin and death, and when I thought of that, I felt extremely blessed, lucky, and LOVED. I lnow the Bible speaks of this, and I am not saying this film should replace the Living Word of God, but it was for me a reminder of all that I just mentioned here.In short, go and see this if you can. It is a film that will make you cringe, and likely weep with the brutality it depicts, but it will also likely touch your heart and move you in a way that few movies ever can. To me it is the most moving film of the past 11 years. I hope that you can go see it, and if you do, may you come away with a reminder of just how much the Lord Jesus Christ really loves you. Thanks for reading, and God bless you.\"},\n",

              "  'context': \"WOW! This film is the best film I have ever seen on Earth! It was [way] better than Titanic (no offense Titanic fans)! Finally, I get to see what this film... or this true story looks like. First of all, this isn't a film. It was REAL!!! Big time! Now for my review. This movie opens up with Jesus (my favorite character... or person...) who is upset that he has twelve hours to live, because he is about to be crucified. Hours have passed and he was taken to the Romans. After they sentence to punish him, they start beating him up with chains, whips, and other dangerous weapons. I covered my eyes, because it was too painful. After they beat him up, they want to sentence him to death. So they have him carry a cross, while he is severely injured, but Mary thinks about the good times Jesus and her spend, including the close encounter part which really brought a tear in my eye. When we get there, they nailed Jesus on the cross and raise him up, but not before we see a flashback about his bread as his body and the drink as his blood. After he and his cross rose vertically, they knew the job was done, and everyone laughed at him. However, they clouds rolled in, and everyone knew what will happen: After Jesus prays to his father for the last time, he dies and he will be in heaven for sure. Rain starts to fall, causing a huge earthquake. Now, I think this is a little... flat, but the people who crucified Jesus NOW finally realized they did something wrong. They knew they did something bad to him, but it was too late for that. After they release Jesus from the cross, he is held by his mother, Mary. However, in April 3, the first Easter ever to be created, the covers he lied in when he died was empty, because Jesus is living with his father, but, before the credits roll, we see Jesus resurrected, proving that even though he died, he was still alive. I think the ending was so powerful, and, in my opinion, I think it was the best ending ever. It left my heart thumping for good. The only complaint was that there was no English dialouge, but there's not suppose to be an English dialouge, because it wasn't held in our region. I still think it makes sense to me. This movie is the best movie I've seen in Earth, and it should not be missed. GO SEE IT NOW!!! Well done Mel Gibson for giving us the gift of a powerful movie!!! And thank you Jesus for doing this for us. I will always love you!\"},\n",

              "  'context': 'This is a good film which closely follows the testimony of the New Testament Gospels.  The filming is graphic and detailed and the decision to have people speak in their original languages was very intelligent.  The film has been accused of being antisemitic--partly because of Gibson\\'s escapades-but I don\\'t see it.  It is no more antisemitic than the Gospels, themselves.  Yes, I think it can be argued that the Gospels show an anti-Pharasee bias--make that an anti-establishment bias--but they can\\'t be antisemitic.  The early Christians, precisely the ones who wrote the New Testament, were all Jews.  It is hardly credible that they were antisemites.  They were, however, members of a new wave of Judaism, a wave that witnessed the destruction of Jerusalem and the razing of Herod\\'s Temple.  They didn\\'t like the Temple Establishment and their writings show it, sometimes even glossing over the Roman responsibility for Jesus\\' crucifixion.The film is both detailed and excruciating.  It emphasizes Jesus\\' suffering for mankind.  It\\'s difficult to \\'overdo\\' something as hideous as death by crucifixion but I think the directors come close.  The scourging is overdone to the point of unbelievability.  It goes on far too long and is laid on with too much force.  The scourging of the type depicted may have killed a man without the necessity of a cross.  Of a near absolute certainty, a man so scourged would never be able to pull--even with help--the cross up to the hill of Golgotha.Other than that I have only one other technical comment and that involves the cross, itself.  The cross has become the living symbol of many Christian faiths but many people believe that there was never a cross.  There is evidence that, in some places, the uprights were always kept in place on the execution ground.  The condemned man carried the crosspiece on his shoulder to the place of execution.In A.D. 70, Jerusalem fell to a Roman army and thousands were crucified around its walls.  It seems highly unlikely that full crosses were used in the executions.Ron Braithwaite author of novels--\"Skull Rack\" and \"Hummingbird God\"--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico'},\n",

It is simply astounding. Much because of not used nowdays latin and arameic and much more thanks to brilliant and superior (I could give countless epithets) actors, you don\\'t have a feeling of watching a film. You don\\'t have a feeling of watching a documentary. You have a definite feeling that you ARE there. And that happens (to me at least) not often. One of the main effects of the film is that the story-line is well known. You know from the very beginning how it is going to end. So it\\'s interesting and almost unbearable to see how wrong choices were made and how after a chain of decisions dictated either by ignorance or by cowardice or by both the most innocent person ever on our planet was exposed to terrible torture and suffering and then put to death. We see how Judas repents after his betrayal but there\\'s no way back. We see how Pontius Pilate (shown here as a good-natured man) hesitates but then sends Jesus to Golgotha (he might also repent but it\\'s too late). We see all these people and we pity them for they really knew not what they were doing. During the whole film I had this desire to tell them: wake up, don\\'t make this mistake, don\\'t you see you are doing evil? I think all the time - what if everything had happened the other way? But apparently there were no other way because Jesus had predicted everything that\\'d happen.The movie is really shocking and appalling, and not because of violence and gore. It\\'s the ultimate tragedy of mankind and it is just intolerable to watch it.\"The Passion of the Christ\" has one of the best casts I\\'ve ever seen in cinema. Jim Caviezel really effuses light, guess he was the perfect candidate for this part. Maia Morgenstern (Maria), Hristo Shopov (Pontius Pilate) and especially Rosalinda Celentano (Satan) look like they were born for these roles. I\\'m utterly impressed and dazed.If you easily get appalled by screen violence I can say this: try to withstand these two hours, it\\'s the way to feel at least the relish of sufferings Jesus had to withstand.Whether you are a religious person or not watch this film, it\\'s thought-provoking and serious-minded.And as of an alleged antisemitism of which the film was accused many times... well, I haven\\'t noticed any.

It is also unique in that the dialogue is spoken in Latin and Aramaic, the languages of the time.
